# Reverse an Array
This console app takes an array of an indeterminate length and then reverses it and returns it back to the user. 

## Challenge
For this code challenge we were told to write a method that would take an array and return it reversed.

## Approach & Efficiency
Our solution increases linearly as the array length increases. It is O^n.

## Solution
We went as simple as we could. Here is a picture of our whiteboard.
