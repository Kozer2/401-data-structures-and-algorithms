# Reverse an Array
This console app takes an array of an indeterminate length and then reverses it and returns it back to the user. 

## Challenge
For this code challenge we were told to write a method that would take an array and return it reversed.

## Approach & Efficiency
Our solution increases linearly as the array length increases. It is O^n.

## Solution
We went as simple as we could. Here is a picture of our whiteboard.

# Insert Shift Array
This function takes a given input number and inserts it into the middle point of an array.

## Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
Our solution increases linearly as the array length increases. It is O n

## Solution
Our solution to this was to find and store the middle of the array and then compare the numbers in the array to that variable. Once it was larger than a number in the array we inserted the given number.
